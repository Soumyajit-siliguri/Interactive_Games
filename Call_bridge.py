    RULE FOR THE GAME
    A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2   in terms of value
    The Player initially makes a Call, i.e the expected number of wins in a match
    For Each Round the Starter Player (Winner of the previous round) selects the COLOUR TYPE of the Card.
    Every Other Player needs to give cards matching with the Card Type.
    Card with the highest value, sets the winner of the round.
    If the Players dont have Card of same type, They Can Use Cards of TRUMP type.
    Any TRUMP card has always more value than other regular Card types.
    If Two or more player happen to give TRUMP CARDs then, 
    Trump Card with higher value is considered winning card.
