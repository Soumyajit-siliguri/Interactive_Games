# To mimic the rolling of dice from (1-6) randomly.
# Â© Soumyajit Sinha | update entry : 14-08-2019

# cases involved:-
# 1. random experiment for 1 dice
# 2. random experiment for 2 dices
# 3. random expriment for 'n' number of dices (limited b/w 1-25)

# input- number of dices, 'play'
# ouput- numbers displayed , asking (play again? OR exit?)
### shows error of non-termination if number of die are asked, after the value is given beyond range
